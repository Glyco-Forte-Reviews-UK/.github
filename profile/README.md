**What is Glyco Forte UK?**

Managing blood sugar levels is not just important for those with diabetes. Maintaining stable blood sugar is crucial for overall health, as fluctuations can lead to a host of problems, including fatigue, mood swings, weight gain, and long-term complications such as heart disease. Poor blood sugar control over time can result in insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Thus, proactive blood sugar management is essential for preventing serious health issues.

**The Science Behind Blood Sugar Control**

Blood sugar, or glucose, is an essential source of energy for the body. However, consistently high or low blood sugar levels can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Glucose metabolism refers to how your body processes sugar to be used as energy. When you eat carbohydrates, they are broken down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. The hormone insulin helps move glucose from your blood into your cells. When this process becomes inefficient, it leads to insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels.
